## Overview

## Offset pagination

skip
first

> Wouldn't use last!

Next page might contain the same records as the last if new records added

Fifth page where page size == 10:

```js
const results = await prisma.post.findMany({
  skip: 40,
  first: 10,
  orderBy: {
    title: 'asc',
  },
  select: {
    title: true,
  },
})
```

SQLite query:

```sql
SELECT `dev`.`post`.`id`,
       `dev`.`post`.`title`
FROM   `dev`.`post`
WHERE  1 = 1
ORDER  BY `dev`.`post`.`title` ASC,
          `dev`.`post`.`id` ASC
LIMIT  ? offset ?
```

- before
- last

OR

- after
- first

Can only paginate on ID - unique user input.

Never order by - messes up results
